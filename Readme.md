# ExpANSIon
ExpANSIon aims to be a 2D adventure game completely rendered 
by printing ANSI characters to the terminal.  It currently 
features procedurally generated terrain and biomes (al la 
Minecraft).  It is little more than a proof of concept at the 
moment.

## Running
Only known to work with Ruby 1.9.3 in iTerm2 (OS X Mountain Lion).
You'll need the perlin, paint and active_support gems installed.

Just clone the repo, cd into the directory and run
```bash
ruby lib/application.rb
```
Navigate around with vim movement keys (`h`,`j`,`k`,`l`).
Press `x` to exit.
